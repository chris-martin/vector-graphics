Rubick's Cube
=============

This depiction of a Rubick's Cube was born on Wikimedia Commons.

http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rubik%27s_cube.svg

It is based on a raster from user *Fredrik* added in November 2005.
I submitted the vectorized version (as *Booyabazooka*) in November 2006.
It received a small adjustment by *Andreas 06* in October 2007
and some very nice alignment fixes by *Cbuckley* in March 2008.
